"""
layer_manager.py — Layered Action Space (Technique 2).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Not all context is equally important. A user's name stated at the
start of a conversation should never be forgotten. A passing remark
from three hours ago can safely be offloaded. Without layers,
you'd either keep everything (runs out of space) or lose important
things (bad responses).

THE THREE LAYERS
----------------
  CRITICAL   — Must stay in context at all times.
               Examples: system prompt, user name, key constraints,
               explicit "remember this" statements.
               Never offloaded, ever.

  WORKING    — Relevant to the current task.
               In context while the task is active.
               Offloaded after BACKGROUND when space is needed.

  BACKGROUND — Older conversation turns, peripheral information.
               First to be offloaded when Pre-Rot Threshold hits.

HOW CLASSIFICATION WORKS
------------------------
We use heuristic rules (keyword matching, message length, role).
This is fast and free — no API call required.

In production you'd train a lightweight classifier to do this, or
use a small LLM call with a structured output. For this project,
heuristics are transparent and debuggable.
