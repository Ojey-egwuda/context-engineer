"""
offload_store.py — Long-term memory for the agent.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
When a message exits the active context window, it doesn't disappear.
It gets written here. The agent can retrieve it later when relevant.

This is what makes the agent's EFFECTIVE memory unbounded, even though
the ACTIVE context window remains fixed. You give the agent a long-term
memory that the LLM itself doesn't natively have.

Think of it like the difference between RAM and a hard disk:
  - Active context window = RAM (fast, limited)
  - Offload store = hard disk (slower to access, but unlimited)

HOW IT WORKS
------------
SQLite database with a simple messages table. Each offloaded message
is stored with:
  - Its content and metadata
  - A keywords list (for retrieval scoring)
  - The session_id it belongs to

Retrieval uses keyword overlap scoring — simple but effective for a
portfolio demo. In production you'd replace keyword matching with
vector similarity search (ChromaDB or similar).

WHY SQLITE OVER REDIS
---------------------
Redis is faster and more production-appropriate, but requires a
running server. SQLite is built into Python, requires zero setup,
and is perfectly adequate for this project. The architecture is
identical — you could swap in Redis with a single file change.
